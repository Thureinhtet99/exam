Question 1

- Dynamic routes allow URLs to contain parameters. They are defined as:
<Route path= “/products/ :id” element = {<ProductDetail />} />

- Route parameters are accessed using the useParams() hook:
Const { id } = useParams();

- Nested routes allow child routes inside a parent route. The <Outlet /> component is used to render nested content.
Example:
<Route path = “/products” element={<Products />}>
   <Route path= “:id” element={<ProductDetail />}>
       <Route path = “reviews” element = {Reviews />} />
   </Route>
</Route>


Question 2

Context API + useReducer
•	Pros : Built into React, simple setup, less boilerplate
•	Cons: Limited debugging, possible performance issues
•	Best for: Small to medium apps with simple global state

Redux / Redux Toolkit
•	Pros: Centralized state, strong DevTools, scalable
•	Cons: Extra library, more complexity
•	Best for: Large apps with complex or frequently changing state

“useContent” provides global state access and useReducer manages state updates, allowing medium-sized apps to replace basic Redux functionality without using Redux
